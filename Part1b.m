% Conclusions on meshing and comments on numerical vs analytical
    % As shown in the plot of the error between the analytical and
    % numerical Voltage solutions, the difference between two solutions 
    % are very small at the middle of the area. Howeve, at each corner of
    % the area, the differences are significant. The reason causes this happen
    % is because the corners are relatively hard to converge for the
    % analytical solutions. It usually takes more terms (close to infinite)
    % to obtain the solution with the least errors compare to the numerical one.

    % Numerical and analytical method are both great ways to modeling FD.
    % The numerical solution have the advantage like: easy to calculate,
    % and when there is a condition that there are no analytical 
    % equations, the numerical will still be useful.
    % It's disadvantage is: It usually needs high mesh density to get an
    % accurate solution.

    % For Analytical method, it is usually more accurate than numerical
    % method, becasue Analytical method are presented as math expressions.
